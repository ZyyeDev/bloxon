# Bloxon Client

A recreation of Roblox backend to play Steal A Brainrot as a standalone game.

## Why?
I was bored and wanted to learn how to make a  multiplayer game backend. Steal A Brainrot was getting popular so I decided to recreate it.

## Setup
1. Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZyyeDev/bloxon
```
2. Install [Godot 4.5.1](https://godotengine.org/download)
3. Open the project in Godot
4. [Set up Bloxon backend](https://github.com/ZyyeDev/bloxon-server)

## Note
**This project will not be maintained.** Like I said, this was entirely made to learn how multiplayer games and backends work. Feel free to fork it if you want.
